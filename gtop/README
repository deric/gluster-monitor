Background
----------
gtop is a python program was written to provide a means of monitoring the high level activity 
within an glusterfs cluster. Glusterfs itself does not currently expose performance 
metrics so in order to provide a meaningful indication of workload this program gathers 
each node's system statistics over SNMP and presents them to the admin.

Features
--------
gtop gathers various metrics over SNMP, and gluster configuration data by reading configuration
files (if available) from the node the program is executed on.

This data gathering enables the following
* Aggregated performance - cpu, network and disk IO
* Overall capacity - raw and usable defined by the volumes in the cluster
* skew - time variation across the node samples (helps to identify ntp misconfiguration)
* Volume Details - volume type, together with capacity utilisation 
* Node Details - per node infomation detailing performance and daemon state
* Node state - each node has a status indicator, showing when glusterd is 
  inactive, or when snmpd is non-responsive.

The above information is provided in an ncurses UI, but a batch mode option is available that
provides the performance metrics only (-b or -s invocation parameter)



Installation
------------
* Pre-requisites packages
  The following packages need to be installed on each of the glusterfs nodes
  - net-snmp
  - net-snmp-utils
  - net-snmp-python
  
* Installation files
  The following files are needed for gtop to function
  - gtop.py : main program
  - gtop_iputils : module providing some of the general purpose IP utilities used by gtop
  - gtop_utils : module providing general purpose functions that could be reused in other programs  
  - snmpd.conf_example : example snmpd.conf file that allows gtop to gather statistics
  - gtoprc.xml : sample configuration file for gtop, that provides a means of overriding some 
                 configuration items at run time

* Setup Steps

All Nodes
1. Ensure pre-requisite packages (above) are installed
2. copy the gtop tar file to the /root/ directory
3. untar with tar -xvzf, which will create a gluster-monitor directory
4. Save the current snmpd.conf file, and replace with the example provided in the gluster-monitor directory
5. enable snmpd to start at boot with chkconfig
6. [Recommended] Update rc.local file to allow the network stats to be refreshed every second by adding
   snmpset -c <community name> -v2c  127.0.0.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.1.5.3.1.2.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2 i 1
7. start snmpd (service snmpd start), and run the snmpset command

Single node or All nodes
1. cd to the gluster-monitor directory (e.g. cd /root/gluster-montor)
2. run the tool by executing ./gtop.py 
3. [Optional] Add a symlink to gtop.py call gtop, to make execution easier
4. [Optional] copy and update the gtoprc.xml file to /root if you'd like to change some of the 
   run time behaviours or establish server groups when running in batch mode


Usage
-----

* GUI
The UI uses the ncurses environment to handle the screen display, and provides a console 
that is split into 3 main areas;

- Cluster Info : The top section of the display shows, cluster wide metrics such as
                 node information, cpu average/peak, and total network/disk bandwidth
- Volume Info  : The middle section's focus is on the volumes provided by gluster. Each
                 volume entry shows attributes such as # bricks, Usable Size, freespace
                 and includes a simple bar chart illustrating % utilised.
- Node Info    : The bottom of the screen provides the system metrics for each node, and some
                 indication as to the physical configuration. 
                 Each node entry shows; cores/threads, RAM, followed by utilisation metrics 
                 covering CPU Busy, Memory, network and disk and daemon status checks for 
                 ctdb, samba, nfs, self heal and geo-replication

Once launched the volume and Node areas support sorting (toggling between forward and reverse)
based on specific keys;

Volume Area
F/f : Freespace
V/v : volume name
U/u : UsableSize

Node Area
N/n : node name
C/c : CPU busy
I/i : Network in average
O/o : Network out average
R/r : Disk Read 
W/w : Disk Write

Both the volume area and node area are scrollable, to cater for complex deployments. Each area has 
a highlighted row that indicates the current cursor position. Moving the cursor in the volume area 
is done with the up and down arrows. Within the node area, the + and - keys are used.

To quit the UI, 'q' or CTRL-C is supported.


* Batch Mode
Running in batch mode can provide a remote view of the cluster, or potentially allow multiple clusters
to be grouped and displayed together when using the server group definitions in the configuration file.

gtop in batch mode simply writes the node statistics only to stdout, and so could be redirected to a file
to collect system stats for later analysis in a spreadsheet, or processing with gnuplot, or matplotlib.

To quit batch mode, use CTRL-C.


Syntax
------
[root@rhs5-1 ~]# gtop.py -h
Usage: gtop.py [options] argument 

This program uses snmp to gather and present various operational metrics
from gluster nodes to provide a single view of a cluster, that refreshes
every 5 seconds.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --no-heading      suppress headings
  -s SERVERLIST, --servers=SERVERLIST
                        Comma separated list of names/IP (default uses
                        gluster's peers file)
  -b BGMODE, --bg-mode=BGMODE
                        Which data to display in 'batch' mode ['nodes', 'all',
                        'summary'], (default is nodes)
  -f DATAFORMAT, --format=DATAFORMAT
                        Output type raw or readable(default)
  -g GROUPNAME, --server-group=GROUPNAME
                        Name of a server group define in the users XML config
                        file)
